### Sound Services

<img src="/imgs/services/holi.jpg" width="40%" style="float: left; margin: 2em; border-radius: 0.2em;">

From the smallest pair of speakers on stands, to a 25 kilowatt arena sound system and a new d&b Line Array, TEC have the capability to serve a wide variety of venues and audiences, suited to what your event requires.

#### PA & Amplifiers
Our smaller systems are great for conferences, talks, presentations and recitals in a smaller venue. These speakers can also be turned on their side and used as monitors (foldback) for bands and concerts.

Meanwhile, our larger PA systems can be used in a number of different configurations to provide the sound you want for the venue you’ve got, as loud as you want it (within reason!). We use both the Nexo Alpha and Alpha E lines of PA to find the best configuration for your event.

{{<figure src="/imgs/services/nexo-stack.png" title="Nexo Alpha Stack" class="center">}}

To complement our Nexo PA, we have invested in a d&b T-10 Line Array system, which can also be used in a point source configuration. This allows us greater flexibility than ever before in getting the perfect configuration for every event, in every venue.

Our amplifier stock is perfectly suited to our PA stock, many featuring in-house tweaks coupled with custom cabling to allow for every circumstance. TEC can meet any requirements in terms of noise, speaker arrangement and power availability.

When receiving a sound package from TEC, the charge for the amplifiers are included with the speakers themselves as a combined cost.

#### Multicores

TEC’s multicore system is bespoke to complement our PA system and, much like our PA itself, is available in a number of configurations based on the size of your event. Big festival stage with a big band? You’ll want our large multicore system. Couple of smaller bands? Our small multicore system will be perfect. Featuring up to 48 and 24 inputs respectively, both of our multicores feature harting connectors and XLR fan outs, as well as 8 channels of returns, travelling up to 100m.

At the stage end, we provide a stage box for both multicores as well as satellite boxes to allow for a large stage area. The stage box allows for custom patching, satellite box extensions and even a passive split of the input signal to allow for two control positions.

We also have a DL32 Digital Stagebox to complement our M32 Digital Sound Desk. More flexible than ever before.

#### Sound Control
Professional setup and control is included with the cost of the equipment. It's what we do.

### Lighting Services

TEC can provide almost any lighting configuration for your event, from a couple of spotlights to a DJ club night. We’ve done it all, and are happy to work to your specifications.

#### Generic Lighting

Known as ‘generic’ lighting, these are the standard dimmable on/off kind of lights that are great for spots and stage washes. They are straightforward to set up and can have colour and patterned gobo filters added for effective mood lighting.

The colour and position can’t change during the event, but they are perfect at what they do and few lighting events work without them.

#### Intelligent Lighting

For when you want to take things up a notch. From changing colours, spinning around and strobing, our intelligent lighting stock can give you that look to make your event stand out from the crowd.

Our MAC 250 Washes give you the freedom to move your stage wash wherever you want, and change the color, during the event. Our workhorse spotlight fixtures, the MAC250 Kryptons, also have a variety of colours available, and a wide selection of gobos. If these aren't enough we have Robe DL4Ss for bright and precise control with a full spectrum of RGB color. If it’s just effective mood colouring that you’re after, our StudioCob LED fixtures are the ideal choice, while a Technobeam or four can make a club or dance night come to life.

#### Special Effects

Under lighting, we also feature our two items that help to give that extra ‘wow’ factor: smoke and strobing. We have a stock of crowd blinders and Atomic strobes, for when things need to get bright as well as loud.

We also have a Martin Magnum smoke machine, using water-based, non-hazardous smoke fluid and can fill a room, stage or tent with smoke. Depending on the atmosphere you’re looking for, we also have a DeMaitre haze machine – again using water-based effects to create a hazy, rather than smokey area.

#### Lighting Control
We will set up, program and operate all of our lighting equipment and control desks as standard. That’s not to say you’re ignored: we’re here to be spoken to, so ask and you will receive.

### AV Services

#### Projection

<img src="/imgs/services/trent.jpg" width="60%" style="margin: 1em; border-radius: 0.2em;">

We have projectors to suit any event, large and small. From a halls film night to a projection on the side of the Trent Building (pictured), we can do it. Alongside our PA systems, we can make a film or a conference alike really come to life.

#### Playback
We have two Playback Racks which are Mac Mini based and are equipped with a 8-channel audio interface and Q-Lab 4. Alongside a Pulse video switcher and HDBase-T system, we have the capability to provide suitable AV services to a variety of events.
