      <description>Sound Services From the smallest pair of speakers on stands, to a 25 kilowatt arena sound system and a new d&amp;amp;b Line Array, TEC have the capability to serve a wide variety of venues and audiences, suited to what your event requires.
Our smaller systems are great for conferences, talks, presentations and recitals in a smaller venue. These speakers can also be turned on their side and used as monitors (foldback) for bands and concerts.</description>
