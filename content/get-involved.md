In TEC, we're all about getting stuck in. We hold two Try-It sessions annually to give new and potential members a chance to get a feel for what we do. Don't worry if you've never done anything like this before - training will be provided.

Once you've been to one of the Try-It sessions, you're welcome to come on any of our events that take your fancy. Whether you're into lighting, sound or event management, you will have plenty of opportunity to have a go with our equipment.

Running events is what we do, but don't think we're only about hard work – we also enjoy kicking back with a range of social activities, whether it’s bouldering, watching musicals or hanging out in the pub. When we're not running events, you're most likely to find us in our office on the C floor of the Portland building.

Think this sounds like something you'd be interested in? Come find us on the [Students' Union website](http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/student-media-groups/TEC/); membership is free for any member of the Students' Union.

Missed one of our induction sessions but still want to have a go? Send an email to [info@nottinghamtec.co.uk](mailto:info@nottinghamtec.co.uk) or come into [the office]({{< relref "contact.md#office" >}}) and we'll sort one out for you.
