Interested in working on the technical side of events? Come along to our try it session on **Friday 3rd January at 15.30 in the Great Hall**. We will introduce you to some of our kit and how to use it. Coming along doesn't mean you're committing to TEC - come and see if it's for you, we'd love to have you as part of the team.

Our Try-It session is aimed at those with little previous experience, but we welcome those with any level of technical expertise. We will provide you with the training necessary to jump right in and be part of the team. So come along and see what we're all about. 

At this session, we'll be covering:

* How to use our lighting desks
* How to make our lights do cool things
* How to use our sound desks
* Mixing a pre-recorded band and using microphones

Following this session, if you're interested in joining TEC, we have a health and safety session that you will need to attend before coming to one of our events. This is on **Saturday 18th February at the TEC Office**. Once you've attended our introductory session, you can come along to any event that we operate in - and the best part of all is that TEC is entirely free.

**Try-It** with TEC, on Friday 3rd February at the Great Hall, Trent Building from 15.30. If you don't know where that is, come to the [TEC Office]({{< relref "contact.md#office" >}}) - on C Floor, Portland Building, next to the SU Hub - from 15.15 and we will take you there.
